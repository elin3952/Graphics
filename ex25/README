Final Project 



This is my toad, Dennis Hopper. Here his is. The arrow keys move the eye around, you start at his bottom. The Page up/down buttons control zoom. The 'm' key puts you in tongue mode, so if you press 't' the tongue unrolls and snap back. The 'l' key toggles the lights. I can not show off anything extraordinary, but man oh man did I learn a lot in a very short amount of time. The executable is just named 'final' (no quotes).
